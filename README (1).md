# ddpm-osteosarcoma-256

## Model description

This diffusion model is trained with the [ðŸ¤— Diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers) library 
on the `imagefolder` dataset.

## Intended uses & limitations

#### How to use

```python
# TODO: add an example code snippet for running this diffusion pipeline
```

#### Limitations and bias

[TODO: provide examples of latent issues and potential remediations]

## Training data

[TODO: describe the data used to train the model]
